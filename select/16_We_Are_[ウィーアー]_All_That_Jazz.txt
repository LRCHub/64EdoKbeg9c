I'm back on the train, to find me another one
Charcoal and steam, and you on my mind
You see I find you in places, like sunsets and melodies
I'm cold, when it storms, you're my summer fire

But if breathing's harder
As we get farther
Forecast weather divine
But if waiting's torture
I'll take another one
For you I'll take another one
You're still on my mind

I'm halfway asleep, I feel you right next to me
The sound of your heartbeat, well it keeps me awake
Oh baby, just as you are, God you're a sight to see
And every part of me is wanting you more

But if breathing's harder
As we get farther
Forecast weather divine
But if waiting's torture
I'll take another one
For you I'll take another one
But, you're still on my mind

I love all that we are
I love all that we are
I love all that we are
All that we are
I love all that we are
I love all that we are
I love all that we are
All that we are

But if breathing's harder
As we get farther
Forecast weather divine
But if waiting's torture
I'll take another one
Ooh, for you I'll take another one
Oh! You're still on my mind

I love all that we are
I love all that we are
All that we are
All that we are
